 Task #1
 Create a method which will have as a parameter an array of strings.
 Return a Map<String, Boolean> where each different string is a key and
 its value is true if that string appears 2 or more times in the array.

 Example:
 ["a", "b", "a", "c", "b"]
 Result:
 {"a": true, "b": true, "c": false}

 Task #2

 Given a following Map:

           HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
           map.put("USA", new ArrayList(Arrays.asList("Boston","NewYork","San-Francisco")));
           map.put("INDIA", new ArrayList(Arrays.asList("Bangalore","Mumbai","Delhi")));
           map.put("UK", new ArrayList(Arrays.asList("Leicester","London","Birmingham")));

           1. Create a method, which has ArrayList<String> and a Character as a parameters and a ArrayList<String> return type.
           The method should modify list, so that it will remove all Cities from the list, which start with the Character.

           2. Create a method, which has HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> as a parameter and a return type.
           The method should modify the map as follow:
           if the country is USA, remove all cities from the list, that starts with S.
           if the country is INDIA, remove all cities from the list, that starts with M.
           if the country is UK, remove all cities from the list, that starts with B
Task #3
          Given a HashMap<String, String>.
          The map has keys and values as follow:
          {"spinach": "dirt", "ice cream": "cherry"}

          Create a method with HashMap<String, String> parameter, return same type of map.
          The method should modify the map as follow:

          if the key is "ice cream", create a new key as "yogurt" and value should be the same as for "ice cream".
          If the key is "spinach", change that value to "nuts".

          Example:
          {"spinach": "dirt", "ice cream": "cherry"}

          Result:
          {"yogurt": "cherry", "spinach": "nuts", "ice cream": "cherry"}
Task #4
            Rotate array in Java
             Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps. For example, with
             n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].
