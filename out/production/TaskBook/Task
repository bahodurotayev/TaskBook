 Task #2

 Given a following Map:

           HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> map = new HashMap<>();
           map.put("USA", new ArrayList(Arrays.asList("Boston","NewYork","San-Francisco")));
           map.put("INDIA", new ArrayList(Arrays.asList("Bangalore","Mumbai","Delhi")));
           map.put("UK", new ArrayList(Arrays.asList("Leicester","London","Birmingham")));

           1. Create a method, which has ArrayList<String> and a Character as a parameters and a ArrayList<String> return type.
           The method should modify list, so that it will remove all Cities from the list, which start with the Character.

           2. Create a method, which has HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>> as a parameter and a return type.
           The method should modify the map as follow:
           if the country is USA, remove all cities from the list, that starts with S.
           if the country is INDIA, remove all cities from the list, that starts with M.
